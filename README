Scramble v0.2

Written by Doug Molineux

Simple C program that unscrambles a collection of letters to reveal real words. 
words is a words list file that scramble depends on. This must exist inside the 
local directory of the scramble executable. To run scramble execute (in Linux):

	./scramble

With scramble comes a very simple regression test script that compares real 
output to expected output.

If you need to generate a words list, you can do so with aspell: 

	// installs aspell (using yum installer)
	yum install aspell

	// extract word list to words file
	aspell dump master > words

To compile, with debuggin symbols use this:

	gcc -o scramble scramble.c -I/usr/local/ssl/include -L /usr/local/ssl/lib -lssl -lcrypto -g
