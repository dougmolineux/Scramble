Scramble v0.3

Written by Doug Molineux

Simple C program that unscrambles a collection of letters to reveal real words. 
words is a words list file that scramble depends on. Primarily, this was made
for educational reasons, use Valgrind to analyze some of the memory allocation
and to debug memory leaks. The 'words' file  must exist inside the local 
directory of the scramble executable. To run scramble execute (in Linux):

	./scramble

You can also enter a 2nd mode (md5 mode) which will unscramble a md5 entered 
string. For example, the MD5 hash of the word "test" is:

	098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6

If you enter the above hash into the second mode, it will return the string

	Match: test

With scramble comes a very simple regression test script that compares real 
output to expected output.

If you need to generate a words list, you can do so with aspell: 

	// installs aspell (using yum installer)
	yum install aspell

	// extract word list to words file
	aspell dump master > words

To compile, with debugging symbols use this:

	gcc -o scramble scramble.c -I/usr/local/ssl/include -L /usr/local/ssl/lib -lssl -lcrypto -g
